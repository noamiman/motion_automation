Analyze the data and output ONLY a concise, natural-language description of the person’s most likely immediate intention, based strictly on the observed body posture and movement. Do not speculate or invent activities beyond what the data clearly supports. If intention cannot be determined with confidence, say ‘intention unclear.’ Respond in 1–2 short sentences.
